## Paella Player

The Paella (pronounce “paeja”) Player is a HTML5 multistream video player capable of playing multiple audio & video
streams synchronously and supporting a number of user plugins. It is specially designed for lecture recordings, 
like Matterhorn Lectures or Polimedia pills.

By using Paella students can view both the lecture hall and the teacher's screen, get info about the lecture
(slides, OCR, series videos, footprints) and interact with the lecture (views, comments). Teachers can also soft
edit the lecture to set the start and end point or make breaks in the recording. 

If you want to use Paella player, but does not have a Matterhorn installation, you can use 
the [standalone](https://github.com/polimediaupv/paella) version of paella.
