# Build and Install

In this section we are going to explain how to build and install Paella Player for Opencast.

## Dependencies

Paella Player uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as a task runner. So we need to install some dependencies:

1. [Node Js](http://nodejs.org/)
2. [Gulp Js](http://gulpjs.com/)
3. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
4. [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) â‰¥ 3.1.0

First, we are going to install Node Js, Maven and Git. Use your package manager to do that or download the software  from their project websites.

Now, we are going to install the other dependencies. To do so open a terminal and run:

	$ npm -g install gulp-cli

Finally, we need to install the gulp modules needed by Paella. Open the terminal and go to the folder you have downloaded paella player.
Now, run the next command:

	$ npm install

Congratulations, you have all the dependencies installed.


## Build Paella Player for Opencast

1. Check your Opencast version by running the following command

    `$ grep -m 1 '<version>' $OPENCAST_HOME/pom.xml`

2. Edit the pom.xml file and change the `<opencast.version>`property to match your Opencast version.

    `<opencast.version>2.0.0</opencast.version>`

3. Build the paella bundle

    `mvn clean install`

4. Copy the paella bundle to your Opencast installation

    - For opencast 2.0 copy the bundle to: `$OPENCAST_HOME/lib/matterhorn`

    - For opencast 2.1 or 2.2 copy the bundle to: `$OPENCAST_HOME/deploy`

5. By default paella is installed in /paella/ui URL in your server. You need to enable address to that URL. Edit the `${$OPENCAST_HOME}/etc/security/mh_default_org.xml` file and add this line:

    ```
    <sec:intercept-url pattern="/paella/ui/auth.html" access="ROLE_USER" />
    <sec:intercept-url pattern="/paella/ui/**" access="ROLE_ANONYMOUS" />
    ```

6. The Paella Player can be accessed at http://\<yourengageserverurl\>:\<yourport\>/paella/ui

## Configuring Paella as the default video player for your tenant

1. Edit the `${$OPENCAST_HOME}/etc/load/org.opencastproject.organization-${YOUR_ORGANIZATION}.cfg`

	`vim ${$OPENCAST_HOME}/etc/load/org.opencastproject.organization-mh_default_org.cfg`

2. Change the `prop.player` property to `/paella/ui/watch.html`

    `prop.player=/paella/ui/watch.html`
